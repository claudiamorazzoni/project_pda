# Project - Programming for Data Analysis


### Description

This project aims to train the knowledge acquired in classes on the themes of data sets, analyzes, data simulations, plots and normal distribution. A code was developed to create a set of data closer to the reality of used car sales. Each variable (product, price, quantity sold and date) presented a different challenge. The description of each variable is found in the first lines after the task title.

- Numpy package;
- Random package;
- Pandas;
